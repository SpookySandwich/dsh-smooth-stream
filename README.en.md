Replaces token-by-token streaming twitch with paragraph-batched, fading reveals. Scroll follows smoothly while streaming, and reasoning blocks show a live one-line summary.

![demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpookySandwich/dsh-plugin-smooth-stream/main/assets/demo.gif)

## Install

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-plugin-smooth-stream
```

Takes effect in any open session. Settings live under Settings → **Smooth Stream**.

## What it changes

- **Paragraph-batched reveal** — body text no longer jitters in token by token; it accumulates and enters a paragraph at a time with a fade. Batch boundaries avoid unclosed code fences and tables, so half-rendered Markdown never appears.
- **Smooth scroll-follow** — while streaming, the conversation glides toward the bottom covering a fraction of the remaining distance each frame: large appends catch up without teleporting. Scrolling up hands control back to you; returning to the bottom re-engages the follow.
- **Reasoning summary** — while thinking runs, the collapsed row live-scrolls its latest line, with soft fades instead of hard clipping at both edges. When a turn completes, a closing underline retracts — finished, not merely stopped.
- **Markdown & math** — body text renders through the host's own renderer: code highlighting, copy buttons, tables and KaTeX math look exactly like native output.

## Settings

The **Smooth Stream** section in the settings panel; changes apply live and persist:

| Setting | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Enable Smooth Stream | On | Off hands rendering back to the built-in view instantly — handy for comparing |
| Reveal animation | Fade | Fade / Rise / Dissolve / Wipe / Focus / Glow / Iris / Soak |
| Animation duration | 520 ms | Entrance duration (120–1200 ms) |
| Batch size | 500 chars | Text accumulated before a batch reveals; smaller feels more live, larger reads calmer |
| Smooth scroll-follow | On | The streaming-time scroll glide |

Includes a live preview and one-click reset. The settings UI follows DSH's display language.

## Reveal styles

Eight entrances, each tuned to its own rhythm; all recorded over the same reply for a direct comparison.

## Compatibility

- Verified on dsh `0.1.0-rc.6`.
- This plugin owns the conversation view's assistant rendering (the `assistant-step` cell of `conversation.chat.node`) and is mutually exclusive with other plugins that take over the same rendering — with both installed, only one wins.
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`: with reduced motion enabled, all animation and smooth scrolling switch off.
- A rendering failure degrades to plain text for that message instead of breaking the conversation.
